# Create Website

Once Kulfon is installed, you will have access to the `kulfon` command. First, let's create a new project:

```
kulfon init my-project
```

Now enter the directory:

```
cd my-project
```

and run kulfon's server

```
kulfon serve
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 to check your website.

For more commands, just type:

```
kulfon
```
