* Filesystem as YAML

You can specify custom data that can be accessed in your views using data files.
Those are YAML files which can be either stored in ~website/data/~ directory or
using a single ~data.yml~ placed directly in website. By default ~website/data.yml~
is used; if set, ~data/~ directory has higher priority.

Here's an example of a ~data.yml~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
title: This is the title of this website

meta:
  description: Here goes <meta/> tag description.

posts:
  - title: My First blog post
    content: >
      I'd like to start blogging and this is my first
      attempt to do so.
#+END_SRC

The content of this file is automatically injected in all views as ~data~
object. You can access any part of it using a typical JavaScript notation e.g.
~data.title~ for the title, or ~data.posts[0].content~ for the content field of
the first post.
