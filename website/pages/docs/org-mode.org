* Org Mode

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is an information management and outlining tool for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. It comes
with a lightweight, but powerful markup language. The markup provides plain text
formatting. It is similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown][Markdown]].

Kulfon supports Org Mode out of the box. Any ~.org~ file from ~pages/~ directory
will be automatically converted to a corresponding HTML file.

Here's a snippet of Org Mode in action:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
#+END_SRC
