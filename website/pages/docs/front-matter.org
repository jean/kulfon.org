* Front Matter

Each page can have a meta section, called *front matter* with additional
variables which will be merged into the ~data~ object.

This ~data~ object is available in all pages.

Here's an example for a Nunjucks page:

#+BEGIN_SRC twig
---
title: This is my title
---
{% extends "layouts/index.njk" %}
{% block content %}
<h2>My Page: {{ data.title }}
{% endblock %}
#+END_SRC

And here's an example for a Markdown page:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
---
title: This is my title
draft: true
tags:
- important
- essay
---

# This is the first header

Let's write some *important* content
#+END_EXAMPLE
