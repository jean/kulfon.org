* Components

Components are fragments of the screen. They can be separated into two, major
groups: *Layouts* & *Partials*.

** Layouts

*Layotus* are components with "holes", i.e. places within the file where
   other components need to be inserted to have a fully functional page

   #+BEGIN_SRC html
<body>
  {% include 'nav.njk' %}

  <div class="container">
    {% include "aside.njk" %}

    <main class="content">
      {% block content %}
        {{ content | safe }}
      {% endblock %}
    </main>
  </div>
</body>
   #+END_SRC

Here, the ~{% block content %} ... {% endblock %}~ section is a place which
will be filled by the content coming from other components using this
component as their layout.

** Partials

*Partials* are independant components. They don't need other components as
input, but they can group other partial components by inserting them into their
body.

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<header>
  <div class="header-container">
    <img src="path/to/logo"/>

    <nav>
      {% include "navigation.njk" %}
    </nav>
  </div>
</header>
#+END_SRC
